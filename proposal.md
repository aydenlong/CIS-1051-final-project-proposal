# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Movie & TV Show Recommendation/Information System 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A system that recommends movies/TV shows based on your interests and previous watches. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will ask  questions about favorite genres, movies, shows, actors, directors, etc. Based on those questions, a list of movies or shows will be recommended to the user. It will also tell the user where they can watch it, provide some description and details of the movie, and give some ratings like Rotten Tomatoes or the IMDb score. Use a Python library (Ren'Py) or API to pull data or use ChatGPT or something similar as an intermediary to create recommendations and extract and display data. Figure out how to display movie posters and descriptions as well. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Create a system that generates a list of movies according to the users' preferences and answers to 'survey' questions. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Ask user questions for their preferences and previously watched movies.
- Generate a list of recommendations for movies.
- Display posters of movies that are recommended.
- Display descriptions and details of movies recommended.
- Display rotten tomato score and/or IMDb score of movies recommended. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add in TV shows and more details about movies and shows that are reccomended. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps include researching APIs like TMDb, OMDb, or JustWatch to determine how to retrieve movie/show data, ratings, and availability. I will also need to learn how to work with JSON data from these APIs, handle API authentication, and extract/display specific fields such as titles, descriptions, ratings, and images. Additionally, I may explore GUI frameworks like Tkinter or web frameworks like Flask if I choose to go beyond the command line. If time permits, I may also look into using ChatGPTâ€™s API or a similar service to help with personalized recommendation generation. Then, I will plan out the program structure and determine how user input will map to relevant data queries and recommendations. Lastly, look into using RenPy for a more immersive and visual experience.
